# Digital Image Processing

This repository contains Python implementations of various digital image processing techniques. The primary focus is on applying different transformations and enhancements to images, including mapping equations, digital negatives, and histogram adjustments.

## Features

1. **Mapping Equations (Linear and Non-linear)**
   - Apply linear and non-linear transformations to image intensity values.
   - Users can select specific ranges for input, allowing for customized transformations.

2. **Digital Negative**
   - Generate the negative of an image by inverting its pixel values.
   - Useful for certain types of image analysis and artistic effects.

3. **Histogram Stretch and Shrink**
   - Modify the contrast of an image by stretching or shrinking its histogram.
   - Enhance the visibility of details in the image by redistributing pixel values.

## Included Files

- **`q1.py`**: Contains code for implementing mapping equations.
- **`q2.py`**: Includes the implementation for generating digital negatives.
- **`q3.py`**: Handles histogram stretching and shrinking operations.
- **`eagle.png`** and **`flower.png`**: Sample images used for demonstrating the processing techniques.

## Requirements
- Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV (cv2), matplotlib
